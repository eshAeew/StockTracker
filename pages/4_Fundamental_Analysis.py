                - **PE Ratio (TTM)**: Price-to-Earnings ratio measures the current share price relative to its per-share earnings over the last 12 months. Higher PE suggests expectations of higher growth.
                - **Forward PE**: Similar to PE ratio but uses forecasted earnings.
                - **PEG Ratio**: PE ratio divided by the growth rate of earnings. A lower PEG (< 1) may indicate an undervalued stock.
                - **Price to Sales (TTM)**: Share price divided by sales per share. Lower values may indicate undervaluation.
                - **Price to Book**: Share price divided by book value per share. Values under 1 might suggest an undervalued stock.
                - **Enterprise Value/EBITDA**: A ratio used to determine the value of a company. Lower values may indicate undervaluation.

                - **Payout Ratio**: Proportion of earnings paid out as dividends.
                
                ### Risk Metrics
                - **Beta (5Y Monthly)**: Measure of stock volatility compared to the market. Beta > 1 indicates higher volatility.
                - **Debt to Equity**: Total liabilities divided by shareholder equity, showing financial leverage.
